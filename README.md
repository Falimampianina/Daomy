This is an app for a domino game based on the Malagasy (from Madagascar) playstyle.  
What are the rules:  
  -the initial domino set contains 28 different dominoes  
  -two or three players play together (against each other)  
  -every player becomes randomly 7 dominoes  
  -every player sees his 7 dominoes but neither others nor the rest of the set  
  -from the very beginning, the player with the most high weight double ([6 , 6] > [5, 5] > ...) domino begins  
  -and then the players play alternatively until one player runs out of domino or no player has a domino that he can play
